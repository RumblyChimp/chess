    <h2>Chess made in java! by Tristan Kitto</h2>

    <p>A personal project of mine combining 2 of my hobbies, coding and chess.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Play chess locally with friends</li>
        <li>Support for standard chess rules including castling and en passant</li>
        <li>Visual representation of the chess board using Java Swing library</li>
        <li>Mouse inputs for making moves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository:</li>
    </ol>

    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/tristankitto/chess.git
</code></pre>

    <ol start="2">
        <li>Navigate to the directory and compile the Java source code:</li>
    </ol>

    <pre><code>javac *.java
</code></pre>

    <ol start="3">
        <li>Run the game:</li>
    </ol>

    <pre><code>java Chess.java
</code></pre>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>The game starts with a standard chess board displayed in a new window.</li>
        <li>Each player takes turn moving a piece, with the white pieces moving first.</li>
        <li>Moves are made by clicking and dragging a piece to the desired square. Invalid moves will result in the
            piece
            moving back to where it started.</li>
        <li>Checkmate occurs when a player's king is in a position to be captured (in "check") and there is no legal
            move
            that can prevent its capture, resulting in the end of the game.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Planned Features</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Promoting pawns when they reach the back rank.</li>
        <li>Clicking on a piece to show all valid moves.</li>
        <li>Confirming when a king has been checked or checkmated and by extension ensuring no illegal moves can be
            made.
        </li>
        <li>Undo/Redo moves.</li>
    </ul>
